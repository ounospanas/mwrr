Modality-wise relational reasoning for one-shot sensor-based activity recognition

### Overal Description
This repo introduces the modality-wise relational reasoning network used for the one-shot learning setting in the task of Human Activity Recognition.

### Datasets
We preprocessed and created query signal-comparison signals pairs to evaluate our approach using the following datasets:
- [PAMAP2](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/pamap2+physical+activity+monitoring)
- [UCL](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones)

### Acknowledgment
This research is co-financed by Greece and the European Union (European Social Fund- ESF) through the Operational Program <<Human Resources Development, Education and Lifelong Learning 2014-2020>> in the context of the project “On applying Deep Learning techniques to insufficient labeled sensor data for gesture recognition” (MIS 5050324).
